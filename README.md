*Coin change problem*

Task 1: A vending machine contains certain quantities of coins and notes, and we want to determine if it can provide a given list of changes. (Since the operating system of the vending machine runs in a Jupyter notebook, the currency it uses is the euro (â‚¬) and not the dollar ($), which is more complicated to handle in a Jupyter Notebook.) With time compleaxity of O(kn).


Recursively evaluating a mathematical expression:


Task 2: A mathematical expression is a combination of symbols (numbers, operations, etc). In this question, we limit the mathematical expressions that we consider to those that are a single number and those that take the form "(expression) operator (expression)", for instance "9", "4 + 5", "(12/3) + 5" or "(12/3) + (6-1)". We will represent these in Python using lists, where one list will contain a single expression:

    "9" is [9]
    "4 + 5" is [[4], plus, [5]]
    "(12/3) + 5" is [[[12], divide, [3]], plus, [5]]
    "(12/3) + (6-1)" is [[[12], divide, [3]], plus, [[6], minus, [1]]]
